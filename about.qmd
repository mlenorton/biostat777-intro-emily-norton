### Education and training
I am a 2nd year PhD candidate in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/departments/biostatistics) in the Bloomberg School of Public Health  at Johns Hopkins University. I earned a B.A. from Bowdoin College, where I majored in biology and minored in math. I also have a M.S. in oceanography from the University of Hawaii. 


### Professional Interests
Prior to returning for my PhD, I worked for several years doing oceanographic research. The more I learned about climate change, the more concerned I got. But many of my friends and family members were unphased. Somewhere along the line I realized that people have so many interests competing for their time; climate change is often at the bottom of the list, and one of the factors at the top is often their own health. ## TODO: clean up !

As researchers in the field of public health, we have a *lot* of data available to us, and more is being collected everyday. However, these data don't equally represent all communities. I'm interested in how we can make sense of big data, and ways we can fill in missing data, to improve people's quality of life in an equitable way. More specifically, my research focuses on understanding how genetics and environmental factors influence disease risk, and how this risk changes across different populations. I hope my research will help inform patients and doctors about ways to tailor preventive screenings to individuals who need it most, in order to prevent cancer and efficiently use limited resources. 

### Personal Interests
In my free time, I enjoy hiking, foraging, crafting, and baking.
