    "text": "Education and training\n\nB.A. in biology (math minor) from Bowdoin College\nM.S. in oceanography from the University of Hawaii at Manoa\nCurrently pursuing a PhD in biostatistics at Johns Hopkins University\n\n\n\nProfessional interests\nPrior to returning for my PhD, I worked for several years doing oceanographic research. During that time, I used mathematical and statistical models to explore biological phenomena, but I wanted to better understand the fundamental principles unpinning these methods. When COVID-19 hit, I decided to pursue statistics through a public health lens.\nAs researchers in the field of public health, we have a lot of data available to us, and more is being collected everyday. However, these data don’t equally represent all communities. I’m interested in how we can make sense of big data, and ways we can fill in missing data, to improve people’s quality of life in an equitable way. More specifically, my research focuses on understanding how genetics and environmental factors influence disease risk, and how this risk changes across different populations. I hope my research will help inform patients and doctors about ways to tailor preventive screenings to individuals who need it most, in order to prevent cancer and efficiently use limited resources.\n\n\nPersonal interests\nIn my free time, I enjoy hiking, foraging, crafting, and baking.\n\n\n\nForaging for mushrooms in the Cascade Mountains in Washington.

Photo credit: Bob Vuxinic, submitted to Project FeederWatch\n\n\n\nProject aims\nIn this example analysis, I investigate patterns in abundance and distribution of birds in the 2020-21 winter in the United States and southern Canada. Specifically, I aim to answer the following questions:\n\nwhen and where are birds observed\nwhich species are most common, and where are they found\nwhich species tend to occur in large flocks, and where are they found\n\nThis analysis is intended for the general public, as well as the citizen scientists (and the graders for Biostat 777).\n\n\nData from Project FeederWatch\nThese data were discovered via TidyTuesday for January 1, 2023, but originally come from Project FeederWatch. Project FeederWatch is a citizen science project that aims to engage individuals in North America to count birds (for as long or as little as they like) to track winter trends in bird distribution and abundance. This project has been running for more than 30 years at this point!1 The data dictionary is available here.\n\n\nWhere are birds observed?\nIn order to understand trends in bird distribution and abundance, we first need to know where our observations are coming from. Here is a figure showing the locations of observations. The points are transparent, so denser bird-watching areas are shaded darker green.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Observing locations for Project FeederWatch 2020-21 winter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBirdwatching locations\n\n\n\nParticipants can birdwatch anywhere – it doesn’t have to be at their backyard feeder! But remember the distribution of observing locations in this figure since it will be relevant for understanding the distribution of common and flocking birds examined below.\n\n\nSince most bird-watching happens in the mid-latitudes (defined here as 35-45ºN), we must standardize the number of birds by the number of observations. The following figure indicates that birds are more abundant at higher latitudes even though there are fewer total observations. However, birds become more common at lower latitudes (&lt;35ºN) from January to March. This may be explained by migration to southern regions during the coldest months of the year. The fact that more birds are reported within every latitudinal band during the coldest months may indicate that more birds visit feeders to obtain food during the harshest conditions of the year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Total number of birds observed within each latitudinal band (high: &gt;=45ºN, mid: 35-45ºN, low: &lt;35ºN).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLOESS (locally weighted running line smoother) was used on these curves. This is the default option for geom_smooth.\n\n\n\nLet’s now explore how often different species are observed. A total of 361 unique species were reported, but most of these species were only observed once! However, the most common species were observed thousands of times! This is probably explained in part because birds are incredibly diverse,2 so some of these species may actually be rare, while others have may have limited distributions or be harder to identify.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Histogram of the number of observations per species.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRare birds are becoming rarer\n\n\n\nIn 2019, the National Audubon Society estimated that two-thirds of North American birds were at risk of extinction due to climate change.3\n\n\n\n\nWhich birds are most common?\nYou’ll probably recognize the names of some of the most common birds! These birds were identified as “common” in the data set because they had the most observations (though not necessarily the highest total count of individuals).\n\n\n\nMost commonly observed birds in the 2020-21 winter in Project FeederWatch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon name\nScientific name\nNumber of observations\n\n\n\n\nDark-Eyed Junco\nJunco hyemalis\n5465\n\n\nDowny Woodpecker\nPicoides pubescens\n5449\n\n\nNorthern Cardinal\nCardinalis cardinalis\n5438\n\n\nHouse Finch\nHaemorhous mexicanus\n4955\n\n\nMourning Dove\nZenaida macroura\n4938\n\n\nBlack-Capped Chickadee\nPoecile atricapillus\n4696\n\n\nBlue Jay\nCyanocitta cristata\n4578\n\n\nAmerican Goldfinch\nSpinus tristis\n4446\n\n\nWhite-Breasted Nuthatch\nSitta carolinensis\n4393\n\n\n\n\n\nMost of the common birds were observed throughout the U.S. (or at least where people were reportedly birdwatching, see Figure 1). However, some birds had more limited distributions. For example, the blue jay and the northern cardinal were found predominantly in the eastern half of the U.S., and the black-capped chickadee was only observed in the more northern latitudes.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Heatmap of observations for the most common birds.\n\n\n\n\nWhich birds are usually found in a flock?\nHave you heard the saying that “birds of a feather flock together”? The birds in the figure below had the highest average abundance per observation. This indicates to me that these birds tend to appear most often in large flocks.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Month and location for bird species with the largest average count per observation. The size of the circle is relative to the flock size, and the color indicates the month when the observation was made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\nIn this example analysis, we explored patterns in the distribution and abundance of birds observed through the citizen science initiative Project FeederWatch conducted in winter 2020-21. We found that most of the observations for this program were made in the mid-Atlantic and northeast regions of the U.S. This pattern of observation corresponded strongly with the distribution of several of the most common birds, including the American goldfinch, dark-eyed junco, downy woodpecker, and house finch. However, flocking birds tended to have smaller ranges but a larger number of birds reported per observation. In general, birds were most abundant in the coldest months (January-March) and at the highest latitudes (&gt;45ºN).\n\n\nFunctions used\ndplyr: mutate, group_by, summarize, arrange, filter\nggplot2: geom_smooth, geom_histogram, geom_polygon, geom_bin_2d, geom_point, facet_wrap\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.
