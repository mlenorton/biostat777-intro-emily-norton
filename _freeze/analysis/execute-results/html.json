Specifically, I aim to answer the following questions:\n\n* when and where are birds observed\n* which species are most common, and where are they found\n* which species tend to occur in large flocks, and where are they found \n\nThis analysis is intended for the general public, as well as the citizen scientists (and the graders for Biostat 777). \n\n\n### Data from Project FeederWatch\nThese data were discovered via [TidyTuesday for January 1, 2023](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2023/2023-01-10), but originally come from [Project FeederWatch](https://feederwatch.org/). Project FeederWatch is a citizen science project that aims to engage individuals in North America to count birds (for as long or as little as they like) to track winter trends in bird distribution and abundance. This project has been running for more than 30 years at this point! @Bonter_and_Greig_2021_Proj_FeederWatch The data dictionary is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kHmx2XhA2MJtEyTNMpwqTQEnoa9M7Il2/view).\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n### Where are birds observed?\nIn order to understand trends in bird distribution and abundance, we first need to know where our observations are coming from. Here is a figure showing the locations of observations. The points are transparent, so denser bird-watching areas are shaded darker green. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Observing locations for Project FeederWatch 2020-21 winter.](analysis_files/figure-html/fig-obs-loc-1.png){#fig-obs-loc width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Birdwatching locations\"}\nParticipants can birdwatch anywhere -- it doesn't have to be at their backyard feeder! But remember the distribution of observing locations in this figure since it will be relevant for understanding the distribution of common and flocking birds examined below.\n:::\n\nSince most bird-watching happens in the mid-latitudes (defined here as 35-45ºN), we must standardize the number of birds by the number of observations. The following figure indicates that birds are more abundant at higher latitudes even though there are fewer total observations. However, birds become more common at lower latitudes (<35ºN) from January to March. This may be explained by migration to southern regions during the coldest months of the year. The fact that more birds are reported within every latitudinal band during the coldest months may indicate that more birds visit feeders to obtain food during the harshest conditions of the year.\n\n### \n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Total number of birds observed within each latitudinal band (high: >=45ºN, mid: 35-45ºN, low: <35ºN).](analysis_files/figure-html/fig-lat-band-1.png){#fig-lat-band width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.column-margin}\nLOESS (locally weighted running line smoother) was used on these curves. This is the default option for geom_smooth. \n:::\n### \n\nLet's now explore how often different species are observed. A total of 361 unique species were reported, but most of these species were only observed once! However, the most common species were observed thousands of times! This is probably explained in part because birds are incredibly diverse, @Bird_diversity so some of these species may actually be rare, while others have may have limited distributions or be harder to identify. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Histogram of the number of observations per species.](analysis_files/figure-html/fig-hist-obs-1.png){#fig-hist-obs width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-warning title=\"Rare birds are becoming rarer\"}\nIn 2019, the National Audubon Society estimated that two-thirds of North American birds were at risk of extinction due to climate change. @audobon_bird_extinction\n:::\n\n### Which birds are most common?  \nYou'll probably recognize the names of some of the most common birds! These birds were identified as \"common\" in the data set because they had the most observations (though not necessarily the highest total count of individuals).\n\n\n::: {.cell caption='Most commonly observed birds in the 2020-21 winter in Project FeederWatch.'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\nTable: Most commonly observed birds in the 2020-21 winter in Project FeederWatch.\n\n|Common name             |Scientific name       | Number of observations|\n|:-----------------------|:---------------------|----------------------:|\n|Dark-Eyed Junco         |Junco hyemalis        |                   5465|\n|Downy Woodpecker        |Picoides pubescens    |                   5449|\n|Northern Cardinal       |Cardinalis cardinalis |                   5438|\n|House Finch             |Haemorhous mexicanus  |                   4955|\n|Mourning Dove           |Zenaida macroura      |                   4938|\n|Black-Capped Chickadee  |Poecile atricapillus  |                   4696|\n|Blue Jay                |Cyanocitta cristata   |                   4578|\n|American Goldfinch      |Spinus tristis        |                   4446|\n|White-Breasted Nuthatch |Sitta carolinensis    |                   4393|\n:::\n:::\n\n\nMost of the common birds were observed throughout the U.S. (or at least where people were reportedly birdwatching, see @fig-obs-loc). However, some birds had more limited distributions. For example, the blue jay and the northern cardinal were found predominantly in the eastern half of the U.S., and the black-capped chickadee was only observed in the more northern latitudes. \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n:::{#fig-common fig-cap=\"Heatmap of observations for the most common birds.\"}\n![](./figs/Commonly_sighted_birds.png){width=75%}\n:::\n\n### Which birds are usually found in a flock?  \nHave you heard the saying that \"birds of a feather flock together\"? The birds in the figure below had the highest average abundance per observation.

We found that most of the observations for this program were made in the mid-Atlantic and northeast regions of the U.S. This pattern of observation corresponded strongly with the distribution of several of the most common birds, including the American goldfinch, dark-eyed junco, downy woodpecker, and house finch. However, flocking birds tended to have smaller ranges but a larger number of birds reported per observation. In general, birds were most abundant in the coldest months (January-March) and at the highest latitudes (>45ºN). \n\n\n### Functions used\n\ndplyr: mutate, group_by, summarize, arrange, filter  \nggplot2: geom_smooth, geom_histogram, geom_polygon, geom_bin_2d, geom_point, facet_wrap\n\n\n",
